  - This section provides information about the individual or organization. It typically contains a brief description, highlighting key achievements, values, or missions to give users a sense of who you are.
  
- **Education**: 
  - The Education component outlines the educational background of the individual or organization. It may include degrees earned, institutions attended, and any notable accomplishments during this period.
  
- **Resume**: 
  - The Resume section presents the userâ€™s professional experience, skills, and qualifications. This can include work history, certifications, and relevant skills, providing a quick overview of professional background.
  
- **Portfolio**: 
  - This section showcases projects or work samples, allowing users to see the results of your efforts. It often includes images, descriptions, and links to the projects, highlighting your skills and creativity.
